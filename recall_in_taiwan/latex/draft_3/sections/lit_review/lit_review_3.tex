	Instead of attempting to demonstrate that accountability always exists for all recall election.
	The purpose of this study is to use Taiwan as a baseline case in support
	of the theory that accountability driven by the incumbent's attempt to
	cultivate a personal vote must exist to a significant degree
	in for at least some institutions where electoral competition is largely partisan.

%	\subsection*{Some Definitions and Stylized Facts}
%		I would like to begin this inquiry by making a simple observation that
%		recall can be treated as just another election
%		an incumbent needs to survive.
%		This allows for appropriation of a number of findings and techniques
%		that have been long established in electoral behavior literature,
%		the first one of which being a simple stylized fact that
%		each candidate with a realistic chance of winning an election belongs to a party.
%		Then when constituents cast a vote for a candidate,
%		one part of the decision is based on the candidate's personal tratis,
%		and the other part depends on the performance of the candidate's party. 
%		One may thus say that there is both
%		a \textit{personal vote}
%		and a \textit{party vote} for the candidate.

	%		\subsubsection*{Agreement Model}
	%		Composition of recall electorate different,
	%		may make sense to rely more on party vote.
	%		
	%		
	%		\subsubsection*{Conflict Model}
	%		
	%		
	%		Recall depletes resource,
	%		then incumbents could want to spend more to
	%		prevent recall which is more costly.
	%		COmpetition for resource
	%		
	%		Prevention of recall may derail more
	%		
	%		
	%		
	%		\subsubsection*{Miscellaneous}
	%		These mechanisms make work independently of or interact with the main theory,
	%		which posit that the party and individual incumbents should both agree that
	%		individual incumbents need to cultivate a stronger personal vote.
	%		The main point of departure here is that
	%		the agreement is no longer guaranteed
	%		as both party and individual incumbents
	%		are incentivized to pursue party vote and personal vote respectively.
	%		The incentive effect observed will be the
	%		outcome of more context-specific competition between
	%		party leadership and their members for resources and influence
	%		and as such does not travel well across different institutional settings
	%		where the power distribution vary.
	%	
	%		\subsection*{Signal of Unpopularity}
	%		
	%		Adverse selection problem
	%		
	%		A candidate wants to be seen as popular, capable of winning election,
	%		a recall may just help party/consituents to find out whether
	%		the candidate remain capable.
	%

	%		\subsection*{Depleteion of Resources}
	%%			\import{./modules/agree}{personal_vote_definition}
	%		Within the scope condition
	%		and
	%		based on the stylized recall device sketched above,
	%		I now seek to develop a theory of how recall
	%		induces politicians,
	%		more specificially legislators associated with parties,
	%		to change their behavior
	%		with a view to cultivate stronger personal vote.
	%		In addition to Mayhew's classical explanation
	%		whereby
	%		incumbents,
	%		unable to influence their
	%		parties' popularity among the entire electorate,
	%		are left with but one option
	%		to focus on cultivating personal vote,
	%		I shall argue
	%		that recall further incentivizes this type of behavior by
	%		its ability to bring in
	%		voters' judgment much faster than
	%		general elections could,
	%		especially when the incumbent or the incumbent's party
	%		move away from the aggregate preference.
	%		
	%		Recognizing
	%		the theoretical objection that
	%		personal vote may not matter to legislators
	%		as
	%		parties' influence on
	%		crafting policies and waging campaigns
	%		is generally dominant,
	%		I will seek to demonstrate that
	%		recall,
	%		punishes the legislative party
	%		by voting out more vulnerable 
	%		
	%		 and increasingly so in the
	%		US where partisan polarization is on the rise,
	%		I will illustrate,
	%		that a purely partisan
	%		
	%		
	%		in the same spirit of Down's voting paradox
	%		which demonstrates the deficiency of purely strategic voting behavioral model,
	%		that party vote alone would be insufficient to deal with
	%		recall's pressure on parties.
	%		Parties 
	%		
	%		
	%		Toward that end,
	%		I would like to demonstrate it in a,
	%		shall I say,
	%		semi-formal model
	%		that illustrates not only the 
	%		
	%		
	%		
	%		I have indeed posited that recall induces personal vote,
	%		but I have not specified how the mechanism works.
	%		The primary goal,
	%		which mainly seeks to answer the question of whether
	%		recall induces personal vote seeking behavior in a partisan setting,
	%		is more exploratory in nature.
	%		Given that the reason for pursuing personal vote is complex,
	%		it is difficult to say for certain which mechanism is at work
	%		and which is not.
	%		
	%		Nevertheless, I would still like to propose a sketch of a model
	%		that describes how recall induces personal vote.
	%		The model begins with a simple model where
	%		the implementation of party policy alone across multiple periods
	%		determines the electoral fate of the copartisan incumbents.
	%		I will demonstrates necessity of personal vote
	%		by illustrating that introducing recall in the simple model
	%		precludes the implementation of certain extreme policies.
	
%	
%	
%	
%	One of the most substantial differences concerns
%	whether it is a collectivity or an individual that can be recalled.
%	Though recall of collectivity, such as an entire legislative or executive council,
%	is rather rare indeed
%	\autocite{welpRecallReferendumWorld2020}
%	and may be simply excluded for this reason alone,
%	I would also like to argue that the scope condition should exclude
%	recall of collecitivty to create a more tractable theoretical foundation
%	for the rest of the paper.
%	%		I will develop a theory of recall's incentive effect that is
%	%		specific to the scope condition
%	%		that only includes mechanisms ofrecall of individuals
%	%		Although I hope a theory applicable to all recall mechanisms
%	%		may be formulated and supported,
%	%		the nature of one of the key motivations for this study
%	%		makes it the most tractble approach.
%	As the reader may recall,
%	one of my goals
%	is to understand the net incentive effect of recall institution
%	on incumbents in a partisan environment,
%	the implicit assumption being that
%	the incumbent's party and constituency
%	may differ in their preferences and that
%	the differences matter to the incumbent.
%	It will soon become apparent that this assumption does not hold
%	for recall of collectivity and thus justifies a different theory
%	that cannot be developed here due to the word limit constraint.
%	
%	To begin understanding how incumbents respond to recall elections
%	in a partisan environment,
%	I deem it uncontroversial enough to assume that
%	the incumbent
%	is associated with a party
%	in addition to the conventional assumption that the incumbent
%	single-mindedly pursues reelection
%	\autocite{mayhewCongressElectoralConnection1974}.
%	Then a vote for or against the candidate
%	entails the voter's consideration of
%	the incumbent,
%	the incumbent's party,
%	or a combination of both.
%	This provides a natural way of dividing the support for the incumbent at the polls
%	into to two components:
%	personal vote and party vote.
