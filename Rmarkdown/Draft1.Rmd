## Proposal

Causes for electoral system changes are too complex to chalk it up to the decision to a single group of people with similar incentive structures. Nevertheless, this article’s focus is on the legislators. Not only do their livelihoods depend on the electoral system, but they are simultaneously in the best position to change it as well.Understanding their attitude toward electoral system changes provides an excellent starting point for understanding why they are changed at all. 

Previous studies have paid more attention to the role of party leadership.In this study, the unit of analysis are the individual politicians, the legislators to be more specific, which provide an excellent insight into the microfoundation behind the electoral system changes. Many studies of electoral system changes treat the parties as the unit of analysis since in many legislatures, especially those with strong party systems, individual politicians are commonly whipped to support their party’s platform. However, whipping works so long as the individual legislators agree that toeing the party line is in their best interest. Assuming that each legislator’s interests rest on their prospect of reelection, it stands to reason that each legislator’s attitude toward electoral system change sets the baseline for the negotiation between the party leadership in determining whether they will support the electoral system changes.

A lot could affect a legislator’s attitude toward electoral system change, personal commitment to democratic values, partisan loyalty, etc. Not to deny that these are important factors in determining a politician’s attitude toward changes of the electoral system, this article takes the view that an average politician values their personal gain far more than other considerations. In addition, such a theory does not preclude the involvement of other normative factors, which in a democratic society could very well decide where lie the politicians’ interests.

This article seeks to formalize the interest of the individual legislator with an expected utility theory. It stands to reason that most legislators do not seek reelection for its own sake. They seek reelection to continue to wield the power conferred by their office. Naturally this power does not come for free as they need to wage campaigns in the run-up to the next election. Campaigns incur costs, and the prospect of winning is never guaranteed. Hence, the politician seeks to maximize their expected lifetime utility which can be expressed in the following equation:

$$
E[U] = q\cdot B - s \cdot C
$$
where $E[U]$ represents the expected utility of waging campaigns, $q$ the risk factor associated with vying for an of elected position of power, $B$ the benefit of exercising the power, $s$ the risk factor associated with cost of campaigning and finally $C$ the cost of the campaign.
