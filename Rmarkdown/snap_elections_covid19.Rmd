## Introduction

In the parliamentary system of government, a prime minister (PM) gets to call snap elections way before the term of parliament expires, even when his or her premiership seems secure. Two questions immediately emerge: when does the PM call snap elections, and do voters reward the PM for doing so? The most common reasons for calling elections without losing a vote of non confidence.

1. PM seeks to capitalize on certain exogenous shocks that buoyed PM's party's popularity;
2. PM seeks to secure the mandate for key legislative programme;
3. PM seeks to take advantage of endogenous economic upturn.
