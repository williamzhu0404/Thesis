# Thesis 
 
 This is the documentation for my Master's thesis.
 
 This thesis aims to study the incentive effect of recall election reforms on legislators' vote choice at roll calls.
 
 Toward this end, this project seeks to extract roll call data from the pdf versions of the *Legislative Yuan Gazette*
 to produce formatted data of the roll call votes from the 9th Legislative Yuan and later
 which is missing due to lack of interest and/or neglect.

 
 Unfortunately, the raw data are too large to be included in this depository. 
 Only selected output of the formatted data is included in this repository.
 
 Time permitting, I will work on further automatizing the whole process.
